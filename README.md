# Dijkstra-s-Shortest-Paths-Algorithm
Solo project Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Paths Algorithm, an application that accepts a graph of connected vertices and returns the shortest path to all present vertices from a parameterized starting vertex. Involves the implementation and use of a weight- adjacency table to execute the algorithm, as well as a min-heap for efficient lookup of the next shortest vertex.
